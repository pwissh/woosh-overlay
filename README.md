# woosh-overlay

My very own ebuild repository, it was kinda inevitable...

You should expect NOTHING from this repository. Better yet, I see NO REASON for you to even use this repository. The packages in this repository will be updated months after their newer releases, that is if you're lucky enough. If you still feel inclined to use this for some odd reason or it feels intriguing for you to do so, I'd advise you to lower your expectations to minimum and to not any take packages from here that you deem important. I assure you it will be extremely disappointing otherwise.

### adding the repository

```
eselect repository add woosh-overlay git https://gitlab.com/pwish/woosh-overlay.git
```

or the mirror

```
eselect repository add woosh-overlay git https://github.com/pwissh/woosh-overlay.git
```

or you know, /etc/portage/repos.conf and all.

good luck!
